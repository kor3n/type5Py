Cisco Type 5 Password Tester

I work with cisco gear and I like python so im starting to look into multiprocessing; the main reason I've made this... Feel free to look over and any suggestions are more than welcome to make this better.

Included is the code and a short 100,000 password list you can use to to perform a short bench it shouldnt take long to find the password, its the last one in the file list...

# Requirements
* python 3
* passlib

# Known issues
* Script will continue on to the end even if password is found at an earlier on in the list.
